One of the biggest impossibilities, but one of my biggest dreams, is interstellar travel. It's depressing that it won't be a reality in my lifetime, the distances are just too vast. But while I was walking my dogs, I thought about a really cool way to do it; what about using an asteroid or moon? I happened to be thinking about Mars like a big nerd at the time, and I was thinking about Phobos, and how it was going to crash into Mars in the future. And that's when I came up with the idea.

Since Phobos is going to crash into Mars anyways, why don't we use it as an interstellar generation ship? We could slowly hollow it out on our journey, using its resources along the way to maintain and improve our spacecraft. Phobos is big enough to support a generation without them going crazy (although it still won't be as comfortable as Earth), but small enough to be able to propel with big enough thrusters. We could make a mini-city in there, on a trip to a faraway star. Imagine a hollowed-out former moon with houses inside, on its way to another star protecting its inhabitants from radiation with a layer of thick rock.

However, even with all the asteroid to explore, I think that people on the generation ship would still get bored. Also, thinking about the wait calculation, you would need the ship to get there in only a few hundred years, in my opinion (it's speculation exactly how long this range has to be), to be worth it. Any longer and you have a significant risk of being passed by more advanced technology, as well as the people on the generation ship wiping themselves out. So, although an asteroid generation ship is cool, I don't think it is feasible. Not unless you can get it to significant fractions of the speed of light.

So, cool idea, but probably impractical. How can interstellar travel, a concept so cool, stay forever in the realm of science fiction? I guess we need to bust out the nano-probes, because they look like the only realistic way to get to another star system. Sad.
