#### **Thoughts on Dutch Culture**

For spring break this year, I visited the Netherlands with a few people from my university. This was my first time being abroad since the start of the pandemic. It was so refreshing visiting another country again. There were many unique quirks to the Netherlands. The history is rich, the food is great, and the architecture is impressive. Of course, the most notable (and also my favorite) part was the infrastructure there. Since the country is so small, everything is on a much more human scale. In any American city, we would be dependent on Uber, but in Amsterdam, walking and public transit worked in all but a few fringe cases. It was so nice to be able to walk everywhere. Even if a walk was long, there were so many points of interest that made it worthwhile. Of course, however, there is no better way to get around in the Netherlands than by cycling. Every road had a bicycle lane, and they were always well-trafficked. Also on the topic of infrastructure, the Dutch have a large system of canals and dikes that have reclaimed a ton of land from the ocean. A large portion of the Netherlands used to be underwater, it's insane!

#### **Our Trip**

Most of our trip took place in Amsterdam. We learned about Dutch history in the Anne Frank House, the Rijksmuseum, and the Van Gogh Museum, and the Rembrandt House while there. We also took a day in Zandvoort, a town on the coast, and a day in Rotterdam. Our group took a twelve mile bicycle ride along the coast and through a national park in Zandvoort, and it was a uniquely Dutch experience. We ended up coming out in a small town in between Amsterdam and Zandvoort called Haarlem, mixing in with the locals. Everyone was very well-adjusted on a bike there, and our group got passed a lot. In Rotterdam, we saw the city from the Euromast, and took a walking tour through Markthal to the cube houses. I would love to come back sometime and visit Utrecht and The Hague, as well as more of Europe. Tot ziens!
