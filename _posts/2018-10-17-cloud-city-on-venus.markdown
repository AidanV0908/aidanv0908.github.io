What if you could live on another planet with enough gravity to move normally, and you didn't need a spacesuit? Pressure is also fine, too. All you'd need is an oxygen mask and something to protect you from acid rain. 

Sound doubtful? Well, it's true. I was reading through my news feed on astronomy in the apple news app and found this story: [Cloud City on Venus](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/10/nasas-blimp-and-cloud-city-plan-for-venus-exploration-and-colonization.html). I think this theory sounds promising; Venus's upper atmosphere is actually surprisingly Earth-like. Sure, on the surface, it's deadly, with an atmospheric pressure 92 times greater than Earth's and an temperature of  462 degrees Celsius. But in the air at 50,000 meters, we'd have ideal gravity, pressure, radiation protection, and temperature. The things we'd need? Just something impervious to sulfuric acid and an oxygen mask. 

How does this compare to our other options though, like Mars and the Moon? Well, for one, gravity is manageable. Venus is the only planet in the solar system with gravity like Earth's (about 91% of Earth's), a negligible difference compared to Mars and the Moon, whose gravity is significantly less. So, no negative effects of micro-gravity on Venus. Mars and the Moon also have no atmosphere, so a spacesuit would need to be worn there, which won't be needed in the skies of Venus. 

Sadly, however, we won't be able to land on the surface of Venus. Also, it will be hard to get materials to build without access to Venus's resources. We could use robots to get down there, though. So there are some technological hurdles to overcome for this plan, like how to build a floating city or how to get resources, but I think that, if these can be overcome, a colony on Venus is actually a lot more likely to happen than one on Mars or the Moon. 

I love this theory. Thinking about a floating cloud city on another planet sounds straight out of science fiction. Speaking of which, I hope there is a book about this, it'd be pretty fun to read. I can't stop imagining a large, covered city (for the acid rain, of course), getting resources from an orbital spaceship that's taking advantage of Venus's proximity to the sun to grow food and create electricity. The people would live normal lives on another planet, in the air! You have to agree, that's super cool.
