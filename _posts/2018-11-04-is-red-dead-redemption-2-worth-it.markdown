I've been hearing a lot of talk about a new game on the market- Red Dead Redemption 2. But I've been hearing mixed opinions on whether or not the game is worth the money. Created by Rockstar Games, those same guys who created Grand Theft Auto V, the currently console-only game has the hefty price tag of $60. 

What exactly is the game about? Well, despite all the ravings my friends have been doing about the game, I still don't know. I looked it up and, according to [Rockstar Games own website,](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/) after a botched robbery in a town called Blackwater, our protagonist, Arthur Morgan, and his gang are "forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive." As their group starts to suffer from tension, Arthur has to decide whether to stay with the group who raised him or separate due to his own beliefs. 

Most reviews on the game are extremely positive; TechRadar compiled a list of reviews of the game and, among them, GamesRadar+, Kotaku, The Guardian, IGN, Gamespot, and others all had outstanding reviews on the game. It has a considerable amount of content, an emphasis on camp life (a unique but interesting feature), a variety of terrain, and realistic weapons. Based off of what I've been hearing, that seems accurate. 

Of course, there are negative reviews too. According to Erik Kain at Forbes, the game is good in most regards, but has some problems. To him, the game seems too restricting.

> "I hate that I have to walk across the camp so slowly. I hate that so many times this game railroads us into doing exactly what it wants rather than letting us explore freely. I want more of that _Deus Ex_ freedom to approach everything on my own terms. \-Erik Kain

If you're a fan of exploration, that may be a hit for you. However, negative reviews like Kain's are few and far between. 

People prefer different types of games, and before getting a game, I'd recommend analyzing what you value and seeing if a game meets your specific criteria. But for most, I'd say Red Dead Redemption 2 definitely seems to be worth the money, especially if you find the story element more important than the free-play element. I personally have never played a game like this, but one of my friends ditched Fortnite for it, and this friend has been playing Fortnite for a long time, so I am eager to give it a shot. Although I am still debating whether to buy the console version or wait for a PC verison.
