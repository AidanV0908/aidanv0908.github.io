_Rumble, rumble, rumble._ Feel that? It's like an earthquake, but there are no earthquakes on Mars. What is it? A marsquake! Yesterday on the radio, in both the morning and the evening, I heard a lot about a space probe that just landed on Mars. It was INSIGHT. Why is this so important? Well, save for the fact that landing on Mars is really difficult (a human can't land it due to time delay and the Martian atmosphere is thick enough to burn it up but too thin to slow it down), this probe is going to give us insight (haha) on an entirely new part of Mars, the inside! While Curiosity and Opportunity (hope he [comes back online](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/no-word-from-mars-rover-opportunity-as-dust-storm-worsens/) soon!) patrol the surface, looking at cool rocks, INSIGHT will be seeing into the very core of the planet. INSIGHT is so important because it will help us uncover a major mystery behind the solar system- how and why did it form the way it did? These are the two science objectives INSIGHT has, as per [NASA](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/overview/).

> **Formation & Evolution:** 

Understand the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets through investigation of the interior structure and processes of Mars. 

**Tectonic Activity:** 

Determine the present level of tectonic activity and meteorite impact rate on Mars.

It will do this with three primary instruments: SEIS, HP3, and RISE. SEIS is a seismometer, HP3 measures the heat coming from Mars's core, and RISE measures the wobble from the Sun on Mars's north pole, to get information on the metal core. These three instruments will help INSIGHT achieve its goals. But why does it matter whether INSIGHT does its job? Who cares what the inside of Mars looks like? Well, it could also provide fundamental insight (the name is really appropriate) on the other terrestrial planets, including the Earth, and help prove whether our current planetary formation models are right. And the formation of the Earth is a huge question I have, and it should be big for you too, because it will help us solve the greatest mystery of all: how did we get here? I, for one, am super excited. A mission examining the inside of a planet shows how far we have come in planetary science, and its the next step to understanding our solar system.
