#### **What I Did**
My trip in Vietnam began in Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon. I flew there by myself, and met up with two friends upon landing in the city. The reason we chose Vietnam as a destination was because we had another friend from there. He ended up not being able to go, unfortunately, but he was able to give us some advice for things to do and places to see. During our trip, we went to the following locations, in order:


1) Ho Chi Minh City

2) Da Nang / Hue

3) Hanoi

4) Ha Long Bay

There were also some locations I wanted to go to, but unfortunately was not able to squeeze in.

1) Dalat

2) Sapa

3) Phu Quoc

4) Ha Giang Loop
