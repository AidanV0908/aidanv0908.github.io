#### **What I Did**

My trip in Laos was contained solely within Luang Prabang and its surroundings. Laos was a very scenic country and was incredible for nature-lovers. The Kuang-Si waterfalls are gorgeous and a must-visit, and I could spend hours walking along the Mekong River on the edge of the penninsula. The Pak Ou caves were amazing as well. Another highlight is the religious stuff, including the temples and morning alms-giving ceremony. Although I noticed a lot of disrespectful tourists during the alms-giving, the actual temples are not overcrowded and feels more authentic when compared to Thailand. I also rode a motorcycle here for the first time, which was a cool experience. If you've ever been to Southeast Asia, you'd know that it is an important skill to know over there. It definitely has utility, but I hope to never have a major accident on one. It does feel a little dangerous.

#### **Overall Trip Report**

Laos is gorgeous. While not the top country on my graduation trip, a spot yielded to Vietnam, it is a beautiful, relaxing destination and feels like a hidden gem. I cannot say much for the rest of the country, but the city of Luang Prabang, a UNESCO heritage site, should be added to more travel iteneraries.
