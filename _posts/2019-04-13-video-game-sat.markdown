Three hour tests suck. I just recently took the SAT for the first time, and it was boring and took forever. So when an article popped up on my news feed about a start-up creating a video game SAT, I was super excited. However, apparently this new test has another reason to exist, besides hyping high school students. 

Apparently, this solution came after college was "gamed" earlier this year (you know, the famous people bribing college admission personnel and coaches, and falsely putting extracurriculars on their transcript they didn't do). The game, crafted by Harvard drop-out Rebecca Kantar, is meant to be a solution to this because it creates a game that is tailored to the user, and therefore uncheatable. 

Kantar argues that schools are failing kids for an age of automation. If big companies start using her test to hire different types of workers, good for this day and age, schools will change their curriculum to pass her test, and create people more appropriate to work in today's economy. 

I think that this is a really interesting idea, and one I really want to see get off the ground.
