      <h3> SkyViewer</h3> <h5><i>Published September 24, 2024</i></h5>
      <p><i><strong>Version 1.0.3 as of 10/17/2024</strong></i></p>
      <p> SkyViewer is a work-in progress app to develop a satellite informational database. The idea from this course comes from my classes. While there are many such websites that exist already, I found that too often, when I needed multiple different quantities, I would need to go to multiple versions of this site or data may be missing. I built this site as a satellite information site that I understood and could control the data on, but I decided to make it public in case other people could find it useful. Right now it is very barebones, but I have a lot of improvements planned in the future. </p>
